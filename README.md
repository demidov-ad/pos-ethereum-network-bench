This repository includes a Docker Compose file to run a fully-functional, local development network for Ethereum with proof-of-stake enabled. The setup uses Prysm as the consensus client and Go-Ethereum (geth) for execution. It begins directly with proof-of-stake, bypassing the Ethereum merge process.

The configuration creates a single-node development network with 64 deterministically-generated validator keys to facilitate block creation on an Ethereum proof-of-stake chain. Here's how it works:

- A Go-Ethereum (geth) proof-of-work development node is initialized from a genesis config.
- A Prysm beacon chain proof-of-stake development node is initialized from a genesis config.

The development network is fully operational, supporting smart contract deployment and offering all the standard features of the Prysm consensus client, such as a rich set of APIs for blockchain data retrieval.

In addition, the repository provides a network performance analysis tool. This tool helps in monitoring and analyzing the networkâ€™s latency, throughput, and overall performance.

## Using
To run ETH network:
```
sudo sh run.sh
```
To stop ETH network:
```
sudo sh stop.sh
```
After running ETH-network you can attach to node:
```
geth attach node1/geth.ipc 

> net.peerCount
> eth.blockNumber
```
You can also interact with a beacon node:
```
curl localhost:3500/eth/v1/node/identity
```

# Available Features
- The network launches with a [Validator Deposit Contract](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/solidity_deposit_contract/deposit_contract.sol) deployed at address `0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242`. This can be used to onboard new validators into the network by depositing 32 ETH into the contract
- The default account used in the go-ethereum node is address `0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524` which comes seeded with ETH for use in the network. This can be used to send transactions, deploy contracts, and more
- The default account, `0x123463a4b065722e99115d6c222f267d9cabb524` is also set as the fee recipient for transaction fees proposed validators in Prysm. This address will be receiving the fees of all proposer activity
- The go-ethereum JSON-RPC API is available at http://geth:8545
- The Prysm client's REST APIs are available at http://beacon-chain:3500. For more info on what these APIs are, see [here](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/)
- The Prysm client also exposes a gRPC API at http://beacon-chain:4000

## OS Setup for Bech
Install ```python3``` and ```pip3```, in ubuntu that can be done by:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

Then install requirements:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Profiles setup
Use default ```profiles.json``` to add your own network. Base setup for current network already added.

## Test execution
Minimal test to check everything works:
  ```bash
  python3 bench/bench.py -p testnet --unconfirmed
  ```

Extensive test:
```bash
  python3 bench/bench.py -p testnet -c 10 -t 150 --all
  ```

### Logging
Each execution is incrementally logged to ```bench_{profile_name}.log``` file. You can find there all past results.
```bash
grep Results bench_{profile_name}.log
```
You will also find on the log file all the transaction hashes for all the transactions sent.

### Bench options
Mandatory options:
- ```-p <string>``` To set the profile, must be filled on profiles.json
- ```-c <int>``` How many paralel processes to run, 1 if omitted
- ```-t <int>``` Number of transactions per process, 1 if omitted. We will refer to this number as **t**
  
  Available tests to run:
- ```--allconfirmed``` Each process launch **t** txs and confirm all of them one by one
- ```--confirmed``` Each process lanch **t** txs and confirm just the last one
- ```--unconfirmed``` Each process launch **t** txs but it does not confirm any of them
- ```--erc20``` Each process creates **t** ERC20 tokens + **t** token transfers
